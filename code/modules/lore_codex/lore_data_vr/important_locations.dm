	data = "Virgo-Erigone is an A-type main sequence star with 81% more mass than Sol (the humans' home star), and almost nine times as bright.  It \
	has a white glow, and a diameter that is about 34% larger than Sol. It has six major planets in its orbit.\
	<br><br>\
	'Virgo' is most notable for the presence of one of only two known [quick_link("Phoron")] gas giants, designated [quick_link("Virgo 3")]. This makes the \
	system a popular location for Phoron research and refining.\
	<br><br>\
	Virgo-Erigone is mainly administered by [quick_link("Federation","The Federation")] as it resides primarily in Federation space, however the majority of the enterprise and \
	assets in the system belong to [quick_link("SolGov")] and [quick_link("NanoTrasen")], giving both a fairly large amount of control over the governance."

	keywords += list("Radiance Energy Chain")
	data = "A sparse government-owned chain of automated stations exists between [quick_link("Virgo 3")] and the star itself, known as the Radiance Energy Chain. The idea is based on \
	an ancient design that was pioneered at Sol. The stations are heavily shielded from the stellar radiation, and feature massive \
	arrays of photo-voltaic panels. Each station harvests energy from Vir using the solar panels, and sends it to other areas of \
	the system by beaming the energy to several relay stations farther away from the star, typically with a large laser.\
	<br><br>\
	These stations are generally devoid of life, instead, they are operated mainly by [quick_link("drones")], with maintenance performed \
	by [quick_link("positronic")] equipped units in shielded chassis, or very brave humans in voidsuits that protect from extreme heat, and radiation. There are \
	currently 19 stations in operation."

	data = "Virgo Prime is the first planet of Virgo-Eirgone. Primarily desert, temperatures can reach up to 330 kelvin \
	kelvin (57°C). The most interesting fact about this planet is that it is the home planet of the [quick_link("Zorren")] race, who \
	could be seen as having been uplifted by the various [quick_link("TSC", "TSCs")] that inhabit the system."

/datum/lore/codex/page/virgo_two/add_content()
	name = "Virgo 2 (Terrestrial Planet)"
	keywords += list("Virgo 2")
	data = "The second closest planet to [quick_link("Virgo-Erigone")], this planet has a high concentration of minerals inside its crust, as well as active volcanism and plate tectonics.  \
	The temperature on the surface can reach up to 405 degrees kelvin (132°C) due to the relatively high albedo of the surface, which has deterred most people from the planet, except for two [quick_link("TSC", "TSCs")], \
	Greyson Manufactories and [quick_link("Xion Manufacturing Group")].  In orbit, the two companies each have a space station, used to coordinate and \
	control their stations on the surface without having to suffer the intense heat.  Xion's station also doubles as a control and oversight facility for their \
	[quick_link("drones","autonomous mining drones")].\
	<br><br>\
	Remnants of both Greyson and Xion's mining operations dot the surface, as well as ruins of mining \
	outposts build by an unknown alien civilization, which researchers have noted it appears to be similar to ruins found inside the rings of [quick_link("Kara")]. \
	Below the surface of Virgo 2 are many natural cave systems, dangerous and easy to get lost inside, which both companies make heavy \
	use of.  A noted rivalry exists between the two mining giants, as well as with smaller groups more interested in the xenoarcheological value of the alien ruins.\
	<br><br>\
	The very high temperatures, dangerous (sometimes magma-filled) caves, and the only presence of civilization being mining operations has made tourism \
	for Virgo 2 mostly non-existent, with the exception of explorers who specifically seek out hellish landscapes, which are plentiful with all the ruins, \
	volcanoes, twisting caves, and general lawlessness.  The occasional remains of previous explorers near certain hotspots somehow does not deter them."

	the system to exploit the resources available here for mining and research. Virgo 3 itself has several moons, though the only noteworthy moon is [quick_link("Virgo 3b")] which has native life. \
	<br><br>\
	The largest TSC to exploit this planet is none other than Phoron research giant [quick_link("NanoTrasen")], having built several stations orbiting the planet \

	data = "Virgo 3b is the only moon of [quick_link("Virgo 3")] with any atmosphere to speak of, composed primarily of [quick_link("Phoron")] and carbon dioxide with trace amounts of nitrogen. \
	The atmosphere appears to have given rise to native life, though originally nothing bigger than small insects in terms of fauna. The flora of the planet is rather sizable, though typically blue in hue \
	due to the atmospheric composition.\
	<br><br>\
	Virgo 3b is tidally locked to Virgo 3, and is currently in the 'cold phase' of Virgo 3's orbit. The 'day' consists of reflected light from the surface of Virgo 3, while the 'night' consists of a total eclipse of \
	Virgo-Erigone by Virgo 3, leaving the planet fairly cold for a terrestrial world.\
	<br><br>\
	The presence of several [quick_link("TSC", "TSCs")] on the surface has introduced new life forms to the planet via bioengineering, and now several 'new' species are commonly sighted per year. \
	Currently, [quick_link("NanoTrasen")] is constructing a 'space elevator' for commercial purposes, as the atmosphere of Virgo 3b is inimical to shuttles, and engines in particular."

	data = "The Virgo Central Command is a large facility in orbit of the planet [quick_link("Virgo 3")] which handles the loading and \
	unloading, refuelling, and general maintenance of large spacecraft. The main structure is owned by \
	[quick_link("NanoTrasen")], but individual offices, docking/loading bays, and warehouses are often leased to individuals \
	or organisations.  The position of the spaceport allows it to function not only as a key node for transport inside the Virgo-Erigone \
	system, especially to and from the planet Virgo 3, but also as a key stopping point for interstellar craft travelling via Virgo-Erigone which need refuelling. \
	<br><br>\
	The station itself is mostly designed around its logistical and commercial needs, and although other strategically-placed \
	nearby facilities owned by a mixture of corporations and entities may possess habitation space, the port itself is not \
	designed to be a living habitat - its proximity to Virgo 3 makes transport of people and materials to and from \
	the facility and the planet's stations via shuttle extremely cost-efficient."

	occurring within the Virgo 3 system, however it has grown into what it is today due to what was discovered inside \
	the interior of the rock.  Both phoron and alien artifacts were found inside, catapulting the asteroid outpost \
	into a main attraction inside the subsystem.\
	<br><br>\
	Today it houses a population of civilians, whom work to maintain \
	the colony and support the local mining industry.  The colony also has managed to achieve a degree of \
